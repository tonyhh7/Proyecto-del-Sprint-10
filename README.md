# ðŸ“Š Hypothesis Prioritization for E-commerce Growth (Sprint 10)

## ðŸ“Œ Project Overview
This project focuses on **prioritizing growth hypotheses** for an e-commerce business using the **ICE and RICE frameworks**. The goal is to identify the most impactful initiatives to increase revenue and customer engagement.

## ðŸ”§ Technologies Used
- **Python** (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn)
- **Data Analysis & Visualization**
- **Hypothesis Testing** (ICE, RICE frameworks)

## ðŸ“ˆ Key Findings
- The highest-priority hypothesis, based on **RICE scoring**, was related to improving **checkout conversion rates**, expected to generate the **most significant revenue increase**.
- **ICE vs. RICE Comparison:** The RICE framework provided a more balanced prioritization by considering **reach**, making it more suitable for scalable e-commerce strategies.
